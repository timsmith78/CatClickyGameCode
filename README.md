# CatClickyGame
U of M Bootcamp Assignment 15: React intro

This is a simple memory game.  The page displays 10 pictures of similar-looking tuxedo cats.  Each time you click a cat, the pictures will reorder themselves.  The goal is to remember which cats you have already clicked so you don't click the same one twice!

The purpose of this project was to introduce basic React library concepts.  Most state is kept in the container, but each element on the page is its own component.
